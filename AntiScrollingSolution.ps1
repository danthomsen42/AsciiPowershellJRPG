Write-Host "ðŸš« Problem Identified:" -ForegroundColor Red
Write-Host "  â€¢ Fixed Y positioning (line 20-22) caused scrolling in small terminals"
Write-Host "  â€¢ Terminal buffer height was only 7 lines, but code tried to position at line 20+"
Write-Host "  â€¢ SetCursorPosition with Y > buffer height forces scrolling"
Write-Host ""

Write-Host "âœ… Solution Applied:" -ForegroundColor Green
Write-Host "  â€¢ Removed absolute Y positioning entirely"
Write-Host "  â€¢ Static elements drawn once: Enemy viewport + Combat controls"
Write-Host "  â€¢ Dynamic content (HP/MP) uses simple Write-Host without positioning"
Write-Host "  â€¢ Write-CombatMessage uses current cursor position + clearing"
