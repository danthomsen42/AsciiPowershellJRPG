# PARTY SYSTEM BATTLE FIX SUMMARY
# =====================================
# Date: August 6, 2025
# Phase: 2.1 Multiple Party Members
# Issue: Endless enemy attacks, party members never get turns

## PROBLEMS IDENTIFIED:

### 1. FUNCTION PARAMETER MISMATCH
**Location:** Display.ps1 line ~697
**Problem:** New-PartyTurnOrder function expects an ARRAY of enemies but was receiving a single enemy object
**Original Code:**
```powershell
$turnOrder = New-PartyTurnOrder $Party $enemy
```
**Fixed Code:**
```powershell
$turnOrder = New-PartyTurnOrder $Party @($enemy)  # Wrap enemy in array
```

### 2. INCORRECT TYPE DETECTION
**Location:** Display.ps1 line ~745
**Problem:** Battle logic was checking for "Player" type but party system uses "Party" type
**Original Code:**
```powershell
$isPlayerTurn = ($currentCombatant.Type -eq "Player")
```
**Fixed Code:**
```powershell
$isPlayerTurn = ($currentCombatant.Type -eq "Party")
```

## RESULT:
- Party members should now get their turns in battle
- Turn order should display correctly with [P] for party and [E] for enemy
- Each party member should be able to Attack, Defend, Cast Spells, Use Items, or Run
- No more endless enemy attack loops

## TESTING INSTRUCTIONS:

1. Run .\Display.ps1 to start the game
2. Navigate to a door (+ symbol) to enter a dungeon or battle area
3. Walk into an enemy character to trigger combat
4. Verify that:
   - Turn order shows party members with [P] prefix
   - Each party member gets prompted for actions ("Gareth - Choose action...")
   - Combat controls work for each party member
   - Enemies take turns after party members

## PARTY COMPOSITION:
Default party created in PartySystem.ps1:
1. Gareth (Warrior) - High HP/Defense
2. Mystara (Mage) - High MP/Spells  
3. Celeste (Healer) - Healing magic
4. Raven (Rogue) - High Speed/Critical hits

## ADDITIONAL FEATURES READY:
- Speed-based turn order (fastest acts first)
- Class-specific abilities and stats
- Party HP/MP display during combat
- XP distribution to all living party members
- Save system integration for party data

The multi-party battle system should now work correctly!
