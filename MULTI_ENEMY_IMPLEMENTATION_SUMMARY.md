# Multi-Enemy Battle System Implementation Summary
Date: August 12, 2025
Phase: 2.3 Multi-Enemy Battles

## Overview
Successfully implemented a multi-enemy battle system that allows 1-3 enemies to appear in each combat encounter, with target selection for attacks and spells.

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. Multi-Enemy Selection Logic
- **Location**: Display.ps1 (lines ~155-175)
- **Functionality**: Randomly selects 1-3 enemies per battle
- **Implementation**: Each enemy gets a unique identifier (e.g., "Test 1", "Test 2")
- **Map-based**: Different enemy pools based on current map location

### 2. Enhanced Combat Display
- **New Function**: `Draw-MultiEnemyCombatViewport()` in CombatDisplay.ps1
- **Features**: 
  - Shows all enemies in horizontal layout
  - Displays enemy names and status (alive/KO)
  - Simple enemy symbols [1], [2], [3] or [X] for defeated
  - Automatically switches between single and multi-enemy display

### 3. Target Selection System
- **New Function**: `Show-EnemyTargetSelection()` in CombatDisplay.ps1
- **Features**:
  - Interactive target selection menu
  - Shows enemy HP status
  - Auto-selects target if only one enemy alive
  - Cancel option available
  - Numbered selection system (1, 2, 3...)

### 4. Updated Attack Actions
- **Location**: Display.ps1 attack and spell sections
- **Changes**:
  - Attack action now includes target selection
  - Spell attacks also include target selection
  - MP refund if spell targeting is cancelled
  - Proper damage calculation per target

### 5. Enhanced Enemy Status Display
- **Location**: Display.ps1 enemy status section
- **Features**:
  - Shows all enemies in battle with HP/MP
  - Individual status indicators [KO] for defeated enemies
  - Maintains original display for single enemy battles

### 6. Updated Victory Conditions
- **Location**: Display.ps1 victory check section
- **Changes**:
  - Checks if ALL enemies are defeated (not just one)
  - Calculates total XP from all defeated enemies
  - Tracks each defeated enemy in save system
  - Proper victory message for multiple enemies

### 7. Enhanced Turn Order System
- **Already Compatible**: PartySystem.ps1 `New-PartyTurnOrder()` 
- **Features**:
  - Seamlessly handles multiple enemies in turn rotation
  - Each enemy gets individual turns
  - Speed-based turn order maintained

### 8. Simple Enemy AI (As Requested)
- **Location**: Display.ps1 enemy turn section
- **Simplifications**:
  - Reduced spell casting chance from 60% to 50%
  - Basic healing logic (heal if HP < 40%)
  - Simple target selection (random living party member)
  - Individual enemy decision-making

### 9. Testing Features
- **Obliterate Spell**: 1 MP cost, 1000 damage (instant kill for testing)
- **Added to all classes**: Warrior, Mage, Healer, Rogue, Player
- **Easy Removal**: Can be removed by editing Spells.ps1 and class definitions

## Files Modified

1. **Display.ps1**
   - Multi-enemy selection logic
   - Target selection for attacks/spells
   - Enemy status display for multiple enemies
   - Victory condition updates
   - Enhanced enemy AI references

2. **CombatDisplay.ps1**
   - New `Draw-MultiEnemyCombatViewport()` function
   - New `Show-EnemyTargetSelection()` function
   - Multi-enemy display capabilities

3. **Spells.ps1**
   - Added "Obliterate" testing spell

4. **PartySystem.ps1**
   - Added "Obliterate" to all character classes

5. **Player.ps1**
   - Added "Obliterate" to Player spells

## Testing Instructions

1. **Run the main game**: `.\Display.ps1`
2. **Move around**: Walk until you encounter enemies
3. **Battle Features**:
   - You'll face 1-3 enemies randomly
   - Press 'A' for Attack - target selection appears if multiple enemies
   - Press 'S' for Spells - attack spells will show target selection
   - Use "Obliterate" spell to instantly defeat enemies for testing

## Technical Details

- **Enemy Limit**: Maximum 3 enemies (as requested for simplicity)
- **Target Selection**: Numbered system (1, 2, 3) with cancel option (0)

- **Performance**: Efficient with minimal screen clearing
- **Compatibility**: Maintains backward compatibility with existing save system

## Future Enhancements (Not Implemented)

- Formation-based positioning (mentioned in roadmap)
- Enemy group types/themes
- Area-of-effect spells
- More complex enemy AI strategies
- Visual improvements for enemy layout

## Success Metrics

✅ Multiple enemies per battle (1-3 enemies)
✅ Target selection for attacks and spells
✅ Simple enemy AI maintained
✅ Turn order system compatibility
✅ Victory conditions for multiple enemies
✅ Testing utilities (Obliterate spell)
✅ Backward compatibility maintained

## Notes

The implementation prioritizes simplicity and functionality as requested. The system is designed to be easily extensible for future enhancements while maintaining the core JRPG battle experience with multiple opponents.
